# Unix Domain Socket Server in C

This is a simple C program demonstrating the creation of a Unix domain socket server.

## How to use
- Compile the code : "gcc your_file_name.c -o your_output_executable"
- Run the executable : "./your_output_executable"
-    Interrupt the Program:

    Press Ctrl + C to send the interrupt signal (SIGINT) and exit the program.

Feel free to customize the code and add your logic for handling client connections in the child process.
Replace `"your_file_name.c"` and `"your_output_executable"` with your preferred file names when compiling. This Markdown file provides both the code and an explanation of how to compile and run the program.
